# Task - 
IPv4 vs IPv6
what is SubNet
what is Network Address Translation (NAT)

--------------------------------------------------------

NAT
Project 1 -- 5 members -- 5 ip Address -- 1,2,3,4,5

ReMap has to be done because of Security Concerns
6,7,8,9,10

Table has to be maintained
Old IP Address ----- New IP Address
1                       6
2                       7


Static NAT: -- Home Network -- ACT, Airtel
Private IP ---- Public IP

Dynamic NAT: -- Corporates follow this
many -- many

Port Address Translation
Many Private Address --- One Single IP Address

Private Address
123.345.23.1
123.345.23.2
123.345.23.3
123.345.23.4

One Single Public Address -- 456.456.12.3
